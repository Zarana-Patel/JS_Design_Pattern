# JavaScript Design Patterns with React Apps

This repository contains implementations of common **JavaScript Design Patterns** organized into three main categories:
## Available Design Patterns

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern:** A pattern for managing event-driven communication between components.

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory Pattern:** A pattern for creating objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Structural Patterns
- **Decorator Pattern:** Adds behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- **Singleton + Revealing Module Pattern:** Combines singleton and module encapsulation for controlled state management.


Each category includes one or more **React applications** that demonstrate how to implement these design patterns in real-world React projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run any React app inside the subfolders.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

### Running a React App

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the desired pattern folder. For example:

   ```bash
   cd Behavioral_Pattern/observer-react-app

2. Running a React App

### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install

3. Start the development server:

npm start
# or
yarn start
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app running.
